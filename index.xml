      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a more thorough overview of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in my career so far. For a concise version, feel free to take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://jhoglan.me/resume.pdf&#34;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-experience:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;Work Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;computer-science-tutor:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;Computer Science Tutor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently work for the Computer Science department at Hendrix as a tutor for lower-level Computer Science courses. My time here is generally spent helping students in these courses understand the fundamentals of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing and how they can be applied in a more general way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acxiom-corporation:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;Acxiom Corporation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From January to August of 2015, I worked for Acxiom Corporation as a Software Development Intern. This was an invaluable experience as it really taught me what it was like to develop in a corporate environment. I did a number of things during my time there, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning the project that I was brought on to assist with. We settled on a system design and moved on to implementation from here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed several Python classes and utilities that were used throughout the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthered my experience with version-control systems and learned what it&amp;rsquo;s like when using one in a team. In particular, our project used Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaged multiple release cycles of our project using Redhat Package Manager for deployment on Acxiom&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery, I created a user-friendly web interface for our project. This also involved a Flask back-end and our REST API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mre-consulting:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;MRE Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the summer of 2014 (May - August) I worked as an intern for the Information Technology help-desk at MRE Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;education:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently pursuing a bachelors of Computer Science at Hendrix College, a small liberal arts school in central Arkansas. I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to graduate in May of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a rather small Computer Science department, with 3 faculty and 9 graduating seniors in my class. However I have discovered that, for its size, the program is fairly extensive. Among other things I have taken the following Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science courses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discrete Mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Robotics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable Software Development &amp;amp; Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms &amp;amp; Problem-Solving Paradigms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Robotics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survey of Programming Languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of Computation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Topics: Interactive Game Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m rather excited about my upcoming semester:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Topics: Functional Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database &amp;amp; Web Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendrix also strongly encourages taking courses in other departments outside of your major, which I like to think is a good thing. In case you were curious, here are some of the more eclectic courses I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in my time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eastern Asian History to 1600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophy of Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shakespeare: Poetry and Drama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental Music Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceramics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spanish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fairly accurately represent my interests outside of the tech sector - Language, Literature, Art, History, and Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;achievements:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e&#34;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a catch-all for things I&amp;rsquo;m proud of / hopefully interest whoever may be reading this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Place Team, CCSC Mid-South Regional Programming Competition, Spring 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Place Team, (Acxiom) Arkansas Collegiate Programming Competition, Spring 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there, welcome to my personal webpage! I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that you&amp;rsquo;re here because you&amp;rsquo;ve been linked here by me, or my resume, or we&amp;rsquo;ve met in person, and something interested you. Feel free to look around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is J.D. Hoglan, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying Computer Science at Hendrix College. This page is meant to be about who I am outside of my work. I have a better overview of my technical experience on &lt;a href=&#34;http://jhoglan.me/resume/&#34;&gt;another page&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to blab a little about myself on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a deep love for technology and all of the doors that it opens for people on the whole. I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in scientific breakthroughs, what&amp;rsquo;s new in software, and how tech can augment our daily lives&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I maintain many interests that exist outside of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I really enjoy building things with my hands, something that I think is common amongst engineers that spend most of their work days coding. There&amp;rsquo;s something really nice about having a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in front of you and being able to see it develop and evolve as the whole process comes together. (This isn&amp;rsquo;t often evident with software.) Most recently, I worked with a friend of mine to build myself a simple table to use as a desk, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied by the offerings of pre-built furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of reading, mostly in the fantasy realm. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved fantasy books ever since I was a kid, and they will likely always be a large part of my life. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly picky, and will often read whatever happens to catch my interest, from Shakespeare to Vonnegut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this one is kind of tech-related. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge gamer. I spent an absolutely inordinate amount of time playing video games throughout my childhood and adolescence. During college they&amp;rsquo;ve become a neglected hobby, but I am always in-tune with what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the video game world. It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see the approaches developers take when designing their games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little about my personal backstory - I grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, but moved around quite a bit in the region. My father is an electrician, and perhaps as a result I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in technology ever since I was a little kid. Most days of my adolescence were spent playing video games and messing with whatever computer system I was working with at the time. I was pretty much an embodiment of bottom panel of &lt;a href=&#34;http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2158&#34;&gt;this SMBC comic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continued throughout high school where I was convinced by one of my teachers to join the school&amp;rsquo;s branch for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bpa.org/&#34;&gt;Business Professionals of America&lt;/a&gt;. I took part in the Cisco networking competitions and qualified for state competitions in 2011 and national competitions in 2012. This was mostly focused on Cisco I.T. stacks and helped be get a better understanding of what exactly goes on when working with a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated high school in 2012 and began attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hendrix.edu/&#34;&gt;Hendrix College&lt;/a&gt;. I came in intending to study Computer Science and was fortunate enough to find that it was something I really enjoyed. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hooked on programming ever since. My time at Hendrix has been incredible, and I have been greatly influenced &amp;ndash; for the better &amp;ndash; by many faculty and friends in college. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in funny dances, programming competitions, theatre shows, tons of collaborative projects, discussions, and learned a lot more than I would honestly expect from anywhere, including a Liberal Arts college and its tiny Computer Science program.&lt;/p&gt;
