<p>This is meant to be a more thorough overview of what I&rsquo;ve done in my career so far. For a concise version, feel free to take a look at my <a href="http://jhoglan.me/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<h2 id="work-experience:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Work Experience</h2>

<h3 id="computer-science-tutor:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Computer Science Tutor</h3>

<p>I currently work for the Computer Science department at Hendrix as a tutor for lower-level Computer Science courses. My time here is generally spent helping students in these courses understand the fundamentals of what they&rsquo;re doing and how they can be applied in a more general way.</p>

<h3 id="acxiom-corporation:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Acxiom Corporation</h3>

<p>From January to August of 2015, I worked for Acxiom Corporation as a Software Development Intern. This was an invaluable experience as it really taught me what it was like to develop in a corporate environment. I did a number of things during my time there, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Planning the project that I was brought on to assist with. We settled on a system design and moved on to implementation from here.</li>
<li>Developed several Python classes and utilities that were used throughout the project.</li>
<li>Furthered my experience with version-control systems and learned what it&rsquo;s like when using one in a team. In particular, our project used Git.</li>
<li>Packaged multiple release cycles of our project using Redhat Package Manager for deployment on Acxiom&rsquo;s infrastructure.</li>
<li>With HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery, I created a user-friendly web interface for our project. This also involved a Flask back-end and our REST API.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mre-consulting:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">MRE Consulting</h3>

<p>For the summer of 2014 (May - August) I worked as an intern for the Information Technology help-desk at MRE Consulting.</p>

<h2 id="education:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Education</h2>

<p>I am currently pursuing a bachelors of Computer Science at Hendrix College, a small liberal arts school in central Arkansas. I&rsquo;m expecting to graduate in May of 2016.</p>

<p>We have a rather small Computer Science department, with 3 faculty and 9 graduating seniors in my class. However I have discovered that, for its size, the program is fairly extensive. Among other things I have taken the following Mathematics &amp; Computer Science courses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Intelligent Robotics</li>
<li>Scalable Software Development &amp; Design</li>
<li>Algorithms &amp; Problem-Solving Paradigms</li>
<li>Computer Architecture</li>
<li>Intelligent Robotics</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Survey of Programming Languages</li>
<li>Theory of Computation</li>
<li>Advanced Topics: Interactive Game Development</li>
</ul>

<p>And I&rsquo;m rather excited about my upcoming semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Topics: Functional Programming</li>
<li>Database &amp; Web Systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Hendrix also strongly encourages taking courses in other departments outside of your major, which I like to think is a good thing. In case you were curious, here are some of the more eclectic courses I&rsquo;ve taken in my time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eastern Asian History to 1600</li>
<li>Philosophy of Action</li>
<li>Shakespeare: Poetry and Drama</li>
<li>Fundamental Music Theory</li>
<li>Ceramics</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
</ul>

<p>These fairly accurately represent my interests outside of the tech sector - Language, Literature, Art, History, and Philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="achievements:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Achievements</h2>

<p>This is a catch-all for things I&rsquo;m proud of / hopefully interest whoever may be reading this page.</p>

<ul>
<li>First Place Team, CCSC Mid-South Regional Programming Competition, Spring 2015</li>
<li>Second Place Team, (Acxiom) Arkansas Collegiate Programming Competition, Spring 2015</li>
</ul>
