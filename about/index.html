          <p>Hey there, welcome to my personal webpage! I&rsquo;m hoping that you&rsquo;re here because you&rsquo;ve been linked here by me, or my resume, or we&rsquo;ve met in person, and something interested you. Feel free to look around!</p>

<p>My name is J.D. Hoglan, and I&rsquo;m currently studying Computer Science at Hendrix College.</p>

<p>A little about my personal backstory - I grew up with an electrician as a father, and I&rsquo;ve been interested in technology ever since I was a kid. Most days of my adolescence were spent playing video games and messing with whatever computer system I was working with at the time. I was pretty much an embodiment of bottom panel of <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2158">this SMBC comic</a>.</p>

<p>This continued throughout high school where I was convinced by one of my teachers to join the school&rsquo;s branch for <a href="http://www.bpa.org/">Business Professionals of America</a>. I took part in the Cisco networking competitions and qualified for state competitions in 2011 and national competitions in 2012. This was mostly focused on Cisco I.T. stacks and helped be get a better understanding of what exactly goes on when working with a network.</p>

<p>I graduated high school in 2012 and began attending <a href="https://www.hendrix.edu/">Hendrix College</a>. I came in intending to study Computer Science and was fortunate enough to find that it was something I really enjoyed. I&rsquo;ve been hooked on programming ever since. My time at Hendrix has been incredible, and I have been greatly influenced &ndash; for the better &ndash; by many faculty and friends in college. I&rsquo;ve participated in funny dances, programming competitions, theatre shows, tons of collaborative projects, discussions, and learned a lot more than I would honestly expect from a Liberal Arts college&rsquo;s tiny Computer Science program.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s a pretty quick overview of what led me to where I am today. Feel free to ask</p>

<p>In the same vein, I&rsquo;m currently seeking full-time employment post-graduation (May 2016) as a Software Engineer. If this interests you, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you! Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:hoglanjd@hendrix.edu">hoglanjd@hendrix.edu</a>.</p>
